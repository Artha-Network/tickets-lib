# ResolveTicket canonical CBOR hex vector
# Schema: escrow.v1.ResolveTicket
# Source: resolveTicket.sample.json
# Purpose: Golden bytes for deterministic signing and cross-impl verification.
#
# How to regenerate (Node 18+):
#   node -e "import fs from 'fs'; import { encode } from 'cborg';
#            const v = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('test/vectors/resolveTicket.sample.json','utf8'));
#            const bytes = encode(v, { canonical: true });
#            console.log(Buffer.from(bytes).toString('hex'));"
#
# Notes:
# - Keys must be encoded in canonical (lexicographic) order by UTF-8 bytes.
# - Integers use the shortest width; floats use the shortest IEEE754 that round-trips.
# - If this file changes, bump vectors and document the reason in CHANGELOG.
#
# Hex (lowercase, no 0x prefix):
# PLACEHOLDER — regenerate with the command above and replace this line with the real hex.
